# This is a conundrum. If we want to see our messages in the thread
# we have to set `record` to `+/inbox`. But... regardless of
# what `record` is set to, we'll get duplicates of my sent
# messages because GMAIL is keeping track of the sent
# emails too. Setting `copy` to `no`, solves the duplicate
# email problem at the cost of not seeing my emails in a thread.
# I'm currently making this tradeoff because the text of my email
# is usually in the email I'm responding to...
