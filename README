Things for GHC
==============

I used the ncurses5-compat-libs from the AUR, but I had to change the PKGBUILD, which is stored in ncurses5-compat-libs.patch

Make sure the following symlink exists:

ln -s /usr/lib/libcurses.so.5 /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5

For X1 Extreme Laptop
=====================

I used the lenovo-throttling-fix python script, found at github.com/erpalma/lenovo-throttling-fix

and the AUR package at: aur.archlinux.org/packages/lenovo-throttling-fix
wget https://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-2.2.0.0/cabal-install-2.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.gz
